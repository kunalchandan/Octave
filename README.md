Octave/MATLAB Work repository
- This repository use for some of the work I have done in matlab and/or octave
- Most of the work is for psychtoolbox, which you can search up
- The 2 experiments currently in the repository are recreations, not official and do not meet the highest standards of rigorous psychophysics experimentation
Have a look around, I will get to working on FEMM at some point
